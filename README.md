# Hello-Universe
## The usual first step

### After passive GitHub usage it surely makes sense to go through the usual workflow and gain a bit of understanding. 

### Even if I do not actually program a lot nowadays, I could keep stuff here as per some of the suggestions in the course. 

### I am now adding more stuff on GitHub via the web interface.

### Trying to push back to GitHub. 

#### Mod from git-posh setup
#### Editing with VScode on W10
#### Fine.
